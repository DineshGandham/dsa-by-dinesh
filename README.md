# DSA Practice by Dinesh

This repository is a growing collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems solved in Java. Each problem is implemented with clear, maintainable code and serves as part of my ongoing effort to build a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving and technical interview preparation.

## 💡 About

- All problems are written in Java.
- To run a problem, create an object of the corresponding class in a `main` method and invoke the desired function.
- Currently, all solution files are in the root directory.
- A structured folder hierarchy (e.g., `arrays/`, `strings/`, `trees/`, `graphs/`, `maps/`) will be added as the repository expands.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Strengthen DSA fundamentals
- Maintain a consistent coding practice
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming

## 📌 Notes

- Follow standard Java compilation and execution commands (`javac` and `java`) to run individual problems.
- Problem descriptions and optimizations will be added over time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Git & GitHub for version control

Stay tuned for regular updates and structured categorization.
